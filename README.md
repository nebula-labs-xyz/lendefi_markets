## Composable Lending Markets Protocol

## Executive Summary

The Lendefi Protocol represents a next-generation composable lending infrastructure that enables the creation of independent, isolated lending markets for different base assets. Unlike traditional monolithic lending protocols, Lendefi implements a factory-based architecture where each market operates as an autonomous lending pool with its own base asset, liquidity providers, and risk parameters. This design enables unprecedented flexibility, scalability, and risk isolation while maintaining the sophisticated features expected from modern DeFi protocols.

## Architecture & Design

### Composable Market Architecture

The protocol's revolutionary architecture centers around composable lending markets, each functioning as an independent lending ecosystem:

- **Market Factory Pattern**: The `LendefiMarketFactory` deploys and manages multiple lending markets, each with its own base asset (USDC, DAI, USDT, etc.)
- **Isolated Liquidity Pools**: Each market maintains completely separate liquidity, preventing contagion between different base assets
- **Market-Specific Components**: Every market consists of:
  - **LendefiCore**: Manages positions and collateral, calculates borrow rates based on utilization and risk tiers
  - **LendefiMarketVault**: Manages liquidity for lenders, calculates supply rates, handles deposits/withdrawals with protocol PoR
  - **LendefiAssets**: Manages collateral asset configuration, price oracles, and collateral-specific PoR feeds
  - **Position Vaults**: Created by LendefiCore as minimal proxies to isolate each user's collateral

### Key Architectural Benefits

1. **Risk Isolation**: Issues in one market cannot affect liquidity or solvency in other markets
2. **Flexible Deployment**: New markets can be created for any ERC-20 asset without affecting existing markets
3. **Customizable Parameters**: Each market can have unique risk parameters, interest models, and collateral requirements
4. **Scalable Infrastructure**: The factory pattern enables unlimited market creation without protocol complexity
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Market isolation facilitates compliance with jurisdiction-specific requirements

## Core Features

### Multi-Market Ecosystem

- **Independent Markets**: Each base asset (USDC, DAI, USDT, etc.) operates its own lending market
- **Cross-Market Collateral**: Users can use collateral from any whitelisted asset across different markets
- **Market-Specific Yield Tokens**: Each market issues its own ERC-4626 yield-bearing tokens to liquidity providers
- **Market-Specific Asset Modules**: Each market has its own asset configuration module for independent risk management
- **Automated Proof of Reserve**: Chainlink Automation ensures real-time PoR updates for each market

### Advanced Risk Management

The protocol implements a sophisticated multi-tier risk framework that applies across all markets:

- **Four Collateral Tiers**:

  - STABLE: Blue-chip stablecoins (1% liquidation bonus)
  - CROSS_A: Low-risk assets (2% liquidation bonus)
  - CROSS_B: Medium-risk assets (3% liquidation bonus)
  - ISOLATED: High-risk or new assets (4% liquidation bonus)

- **Position Types**:
  - **Cross-Collateral Positions**: Mix up to 20 different assets as collateral
  - **Isolated Positions**: Single-asset collateral for higher-risk assets
  - **Market-Agnostic Collateral**: Use any whitelisted asset as collateral in any market

### Isolated Position Vaults

Every position across all markets utilizes dedicated vault contracts:

- Complete asset segregation per position
- Direct liquidation transfers from vault to liquidator
- Enhanced security through position-level isolation
- Regulatory compliance through technical asset segregation
- Protection from cross-position vulnerabilities
- Optimized initialization with owner set during deployment
- Gas-efficient minimal proxy pattern for vault creation

## Market Creation & Management

### Market Factory

The `LendefiMarketFactory` serves as the protocol's deployment hub:

```solidity
// Create a new USD1 lending market
factory.createMarket(
    USD1_ADDRESS,
    "Lendefi USD1 Market",
    "mUSD1"
);
```

Each market deployment includes:

- Upgradeable LendefiCore contract (UUPS proxy) with position vault creation logic
- ERC-4626 compliant LendefiMarketVault with Chainlink Automation for protocol PoR
- Market-specific LendefiAssets module with collateral asset PoR feeds
- Position vault implementation template for cloning user vaults

### Market Lifecycle

1. **Deployment**: Admin creates new market via factory
2. **Initialization**: Market components are deployed and linked
3. **Configuration**: Risk parameters and collateral assets are configured
4. **Operation**: Users can supply liquidity, borrow, and manage positions
5. **Upgrades**: Individual markets can be upgraded without affecting others

3. **LendefiMarketVault**: Manages liquidity pools, calculates lender rates, handles deposits/withdrawals, provides protocol PoR via Chainlink Automation
4. **LendefiAssets**: Market-specific module managing collateral asset configuration, price oracles, and collateral asset PoR feeds
5. **LendefiPositionVault**: Minimal proxy vaults created by LendefiCore for each user position to isolate collateral

### Proof of Reserve

Two types of PoR feeds per market:

1. **Protocol Collateralization PoR** (LendefiMarketVault):

   - Tracks overall protocol collateralization for the base currency
   - Updated automatically via Chainlink Automation
   - Reports total borrowed vs total supplied

2. **Collateral Asset PoR** (LendefiAssets):
   - Individual PoR feeds for each collateral asset
   - Tracks reserves of specific collateral tokens
   - Used for asset verification and risk management

### Fallback Mechanisms

- Uniswap V3 TWAP as secondary source
- Multi-oracle median pricing
- Deviation thresholds

## Regulatory Compliance

### Market Isolation Benefits

The composable market architecture facilitates compliance:

- **Asset Segregation**: Complete separation between markets
- **Jurisdictional Flexibility**: Markets can be configured for specific regulatory requirements
- **Audit Trail**: Clear separation of funds and operations per market
- **Bankruptcy Remoteness**: Market isolation prevents cross-contamination

### U.S. GENIUS Act Compliance

The protocol's architecture aligns with emerging regulations:

- Technical asset segregation through isolated vaults
- Proof of Reserve integration for transparency
- Clear custody delineation
- Qualified custodian standards through smart contracts

## Getting Started

### Deploying a New Market

```solidity
// Deploy factory and set implementations
LendefiMarketFactory factory = new LendefiMarketFactory();
factory.initialize(timelock, treasury, assetsModule, govToken, porFeed);
factory.setImplementations(coreImpl, vaultImpl);

// Create markets for different base assets
factory.createMarket(USD1, "Lendefi mUSD1", "mUSD1");
factory.createMarket(DAI, "Lendefi mDAI", "mDAI");
factory.createMarket(USDT, "Lendefi mUSDT", "mUSDT");
```

### Using a Market

```solidity
// Get market information
IPROTOCOL.Market memory market = factory.getMarketInfo(USD1);

// Interact with specific market
LendefiCore core = LendefiCore(market.core);
LendefiMarketVault vault = LendefiMarketVault(market.baseVault);
LendefiAssets assets = LendefiAssets(market.assetsModule);

// Supply liquidity to USD1 market with slippage protection
core.depositLiquidity(amount, expectedShares, maxSlippageBps);

// Create position and get position ID
uint256 positionId = core.createPosition(WETH, false); // Returns position ID

// Supply collateral and borrow
core.supplyCollateral(WETH, amount, positionId);
core.borrow(positionId, borrowAmount);

// Mint shares with MEV protection
core.mintShares(sharesAmount, expectedAmount, maxSlippageBps);
```

## Deployed Markets

Track deployed markets and their configurations:

```solidity
// Get all active markets
IPROTOCOL.Market[] memory activeMarkets = factory.getAllActiveMarkets();

// Check market details
IPROTOCOL.Market memory usdcMarket = factory.getMarketInfo(USDC);
```
