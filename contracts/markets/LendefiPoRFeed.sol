/**
 * @title LendefiPoRFeed
 * @author alexei@nebula-labs(dot)xyz
 * @notice Proof of Reserves feed implementing Chainlink's AggregatorV3Interface for the Lendefi protocol
 * @dev This contract provides a standardized way to track and expose reserve data for specific assets
 *      within the Lendefi lending protocol. It implements Chainlink's AggregatorV3Interface to ensure
 *      compatibility with existing DeFi infrastructure and oracle consumers.
 *
 *      Key features:
 *      - Chainlink AggregatorV3Interface compliance for seamless integration
 *      - Round-based data storage with historical tracking capabilities
 *      - Role-based access control with owner and updater permissions
 *      - Automatic asset metadata integration (decimals, symbol)
 *      - Real-time reserve tracking and transparency
 *
 *      The contract serves as a bridge between Lendefi's internal reserve tracking
 *      and external consumers requiring standardized oracle data feeds.
